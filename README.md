# VoiD creation / suggestion extension for OntoWiki [edit this file](https://github.com/AKSW/void.ontowiki/edit/master/README.md)

> VoID is an RDF Schema vocabulary for expressing metadata about RDF
> datasets. It is intended as a bridge between the publishers and
> users of RDF data, with applications ranging from data discovery to
> cataloging and archiving of datasets.

  * to generate VoID statements automatically where possible, and
  * to suggest additional content based on a suggestion-list
